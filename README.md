Here are some of the projects that I'm working on:

* [`lux`](https://github.com/luxsrc):
High-performance scientific computation algorithms that automatically
adapt to different hardware architectures
Codes are mainly written in `C` and `C++` targeting high performance
computing systems.

* [AutoDiffX](https://github.com/adxsrc):
Automatic Differentiation for X.
Using Google and DeepMind's JAX ecosystem for other applications,
including simulations in astrophysics.

* [Project Laniakea (`L6a`)](https://github.com/l6a):
Tools for scalable computing platform.
Codes are written in `bash` and `python` aiming to enable
multi-cloud/HPC workflows.

* [Project `Foci`](https://github.com/focisrc):
High-performance computational interferometry algorithms in Python.

* [AstroContainers](https://github.com/astcon):
A community-driven project to create and manage astronomical and
astrophysical software containers.
